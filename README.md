PhoneToPCClip (Android side)
=============
This application transfers an image from an Android phone's camera directly to a PC within the same wireless network.

This way, it reduces the hassle of attaching the phone to a PC just to obtain the image captures, while also saving mobile data.

This application would be useful if the user is in a lab that requires a lot of picture taking, especially when picture re-take is often needed.
